# Table-Driven Tests

> A simple example for table-driven unit tests in Go.

This repository contains a simple [user storage](storage.go) implementation and provides an example for [testing the storage](storage_test.go) using the table-driven test approach. You can experiment with the test cases yourself by cloning the repository, running the tests locally, changing the expected values, and running them again.
